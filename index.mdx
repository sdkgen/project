**sdkgen** is a tool to help design, implement and maintain good APIs with minimal effort. It is somewhat inspired by SOAP, but embracing modern web standards, like JSON.

It provides:

- a language to describe all API endpoints (REST and RPC) and types (strict contracts);
- a server runtime library to help implementing this API;
- a client runtime library to help consuming the API;
- a code generator to help integrate with those libraries.

The protocol itself tries to be simple and to allow a variety of use cases. The sdkgen is not a framework imposing how you should build your application, it is just a tool. All transport capabilities and contained inside the runtime libraries, making it easy to swap.

**Features:**

- Define the objects that will be passed in and out of your API using primitive types (`string`, `int`, `bigint`, `date`, `uuid`, `xml`, and so on), arrays, enums and nested structures. All types will be checked at runtime for correctness;
- Define your API contract as RPC endpoints. The user can interact with then with generated clients and with the web playground;
- Define REST endpoints over those RPC endpoints. The user can call them like any REST API or interact with the generated Swagger;
- Generate server code from the API description, only the body of your RPC endpoints need to be implemented;
- Generate client code for each of your client types (web, mobile, or other server).
